My original childhood dream was to be a scientist with a professor title (thank you BJ. Habibie for the inspiration) or a traffic police officer (inspired by my uncle). None of them were achieved. Now as an adult somehow I got stranded in the software engineering industry, crafting lines of code into the real stuff. As happy as I am now, how does it happen?

I got introduced to personal computers at the age of 10. It was a Windows 95 PC that my father use for work (CorelDraw). I was playing with CorelDraw too, besides Ms. Paint or Microsoft Office suite. No games as it's not allowed at the time. Then my family faced an economic turndown, therefore I lost easy access to this technology for years until around 2006. At this time, I didn't know that software is build on top of plain text code. That is all.

### 2006 - 2009: HTML, Turbo Pascal, ActionScript, Visual Basic

Most part, that was my brother who influenced me. He got enrolled in a high school with a specialty in Information Technology. Somehow the school was not prepared with the syllabus so he got his first year in electrical engineering then introduced to IT in his second and third years.

That was how I got my soldering skill for the first time. His amateur teaching also includes IT stuff as well as hardware, software, networking, and web multimedia app like Macromedia Flash. Good old days. Despite the security and inefficiency of Flash, that was fun and entertaining. I was quite skilled with Macromedia Flash ActionScript and HTML. Even I got some side projects done with Flash.

Then I got enrolled in a public high school. Even though the school has an IT syllabus, it did not have advanced courses: there were Ms. Office and whatnot which were not able to satisfy my curiosity. Somehow their computer lab was quite accessible. I could easily sneak into it as long as it didn't lock up. I learned a lot here: Visual Basic (making simple viruses, GUI apps), HTML (making my website, my favorite tag is marquee), and Pascal.

My teacher and a friend in his college year (yes, most of my circle were older than me) introduced Turbo Pascal personally so I could compete in a regional Olympic competition. Somehow my teacher saw that my strength was not in programming but in web stuff. So he enrolled me in a different track in the competition: web design. I won second place as the only competitor that used the flashy Flash technology.

In these years I also learned about the Linux operating system, also touched a bit of Bash and Python but no real stuff was done.

### 2010 -2014: Linux, Bash, Python, PHP

I didn't enroll a college at because my parent could not afford that at that time. I enjoyed scholarships from junior to high school but it didn't happen to me for college. To stay afloat, I started to work as a graphic designer in a local digital printing workshop, depending on my past experience with the CorelDRAW app.

After months of working here, a client came to the workshop, requesting a banner design for her new internet cafe next door. She also said that she was still looking for someone who could watch/maintain her internet cafe.

I closed the CorelDRAW app immediately as she watched me and said, "Let me be that person."

My boss behind me was like,

In my city circa 2010, the internet was **really** **expensive**. I could not afford an internet subscription on my own. My only options were to spend some of my cash on 2-3 hours a week of shitting in an internet cafe or looking for public free wifis which was quite scarce at that time. But holding full control of an internet cafe myself? Hold my keyboard.

My high school friends may have their time studying in college (yes, I have a portion of envy here) but I have 24/7 to spend time on a 1Mbps internet connection (trust me, it's considered as superfast in my city at that time) and unlimited access to learning resources on the internet. I started to work there from scratch, building and configuring the networking down to crimping the CAT5 cables myself, configuring the billing services, and being both a keeper and cashier. For the rest of the time, I learned as much as I can to become a self-taught programmer. I worked here for almost a year. I still miss these memories.

Once I was confident enough with my skills, I move on to work for a government organization as an IT guy. I do not know what kind of role that was but I became the sole IT person in that organization who solve everyone's problems: from fixing their laserjet printers to configuring and maintaining their bare-metal servers, from climbing up a 20-meter tower to set up a P2P wireless network against another tower 30km away to programming some web apps. Some people may call this role "Superman", a role that could be only achieved with both curiosity and naive.

For coding, I was using PHP and Python (Django). And because I was dealing with Linux servers for most of that time, Bash and Python were my knifes.

In the end of this era, I picked programming as my future path because it's the most fun and challenging in the IT field for me. I decide to move to a bigger city that is closer to the capital city, Bogor. At the same time, I enrolled in a college in Depok.

### 2015-2016: JavaScript and all the JS hypes

It was a small company that consists of 5 people and I'm their sole programmer besides the CTO. I was introduced and mentored to the most popular stack at that time: MEAN (MongoDB, ExpressJS, AngularJS, NodeJS). The transition to the language was the easiest for me because I was experienced with ActionScript which is also based on ECMAScript. The hardest part was about learning how to write good code.

I don't know what to say about my achievement in JavaScript but I already experienced <a href="https://auth0.com/blog/how-to-manage-javascript-fatigue/" target="_blank">JavaScript Fatigue</a> at the time.

### 2016-2018 - C, C++

At this point I was able to design and build web system from scratch, independently. Apart from my fondness on the web stuff, I joined a company that demand me to learning the mother of programming language: C. Then C++. Then Qt. At the beginning I was struggling hard for these ones but really enjoyed the challenges until the end. I also learned how to read and understand complex specification document like RFC then implement it in C/C++. <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc5280">RFC 5280</a> was my holy scripture at that time.

### 2018-2022 - Golang, React, Dart, Lisp and Rust

TO BE WRITTEN

### What now?

I'm keen to learning about designing and building scaled and reliable system that could handle tremendously high amount of traffic. Fortunately the company that I recently joined is able to provide such journey. It's already beyond programming language choices, I'm going to take any language or technology to pursue this path.
