      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m not talking about myself regarding the pull request (okay, I&amp;rsquo;ll talk about it a bit at the end of this blog post), there is nothing special about it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I want to talk about how a smooth and comprehensive onboarding process could let me create a pull request on the first day at work. All of these onboarding processes were done in less than 4 hours. Kudos for the people who helped me!&lt;/p&gt;</description>
