    <p>Communities allow me to see different perspectives. They are like bubbles, but each contains portions of other kinds of bubbles. People from different backgrounds come and go, bringing diverse goals, intentions, opinions, and politics. Yet, we gather for the same domain or shared interest.</p>
<p>I grew up in communities. They filled the gaps left by my parents (who are still alive but were largely absent in their roles). Communities gave me what I was missing and shaped my skills and career by allowing me to contribute back in many ways. It even helped guide me toward the meaning of life.</p>
<p>I learned that a community is like a living organism. It can evolve into a better entity or something that has substantive deformities (I got this phrase from MobyDick) that prevent it from growing properly, eventually leading to its death. When a community becomes discriminatory, toxic, racist, abusive, or fosters bullying, it stifles free expression and breeds fear. I know this because I have experienced such discrimination, toxicity, abuse and being bullied firsthand. That is why I am firmly against even the smallest breaches of decency because, once allowed, such behavior can grow like cancer and ultimately deform the community.</p>
<p>To prevent such deformities, it is important to have a code of conduct that provides everyone—literally everyone—with a guarantee that they are free to speak, question, and contribute as long as they remain within the boundaries of the code. If it is not intended for everyone, it is okay to state that explicitly so those who do not align with it can find another community or create a new one. Another bubble.</p>
<p>The interesting part is that the code of conduct could also evolve over time. The values we hold today may differ 100 or 1,000 years from now—nobody knows.</p>
<p>I am someone who will try to change what I believe needs to be changed before deciding to leave. When nothing more can be done, I am content and happy to leave, knowing that I have given my best to the community.</p>
<p>2025 will be my year of focusing on myself and my family. They deserve, and are more than eligible for, my attention.</p>
