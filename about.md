Hi,

I'm a software developer, currently working for Kodekreatif team. I'm also a contributor of non-profit organization, BlankOn project, which releases one of the biggest GNU/Linux distribution in Indonesia. My current role in BlankOn is R&D team lead. I love bicycling, currently using an upgraded Doppelganger FX05 Raptor.
