<p>I fear that I will always be<br />
A lonely  number like root three</p>
<p>A three is all that’s good and right,<br />
Why  must my three keep out of sight<br />
Beneath the vicious square root  sign,<br />
I wish instead I were a nine</p>
<p>For nine could thwart this  evil trick,<br />
with just some quick arithmetic</p>
<p>I know I’ll never  see the sun, as 1.7321<br />
Such is my reality, a sad irrationality</p>
<p>When  hark, just what is this I see,<br />
Another square root of a three</p>
<p>Has  quietly co-waltzing by,<br />
Together now we multiply<br />
To form a number  we prefer,<br />
Rejoicing as an integer</p>
<p>We break free from our  mortal bonds<br />
With the wave of magic wands</p>
<p>Our square root  signs become unglued<br />
And friendship for me has been renewed</p>
