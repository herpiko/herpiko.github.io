<p style="text-align:center;">The leaves were long, the grass was green,<br />
The hemlock-umbels tall and fair,<br />
And in the glade a light was seen<br />
Of stars in shadow shimmering.<br />
Tinúviel was dancing there<br />
To music of a pipe unseen,<br />
And light of stars was in her hair,<br />
And in her raiment glimmering.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">There Beren came from mountains cold,<br />
And lost he wandered under leaves,<br />
And where the Elven-river rolled<br />
He walked alone and sorrowing.<br />
He peered between the hemlock-leaves<br />
And saw in wonder flowers of gold<br />
Upon her mantle and her sleeves,<br />
And her hair like shadow following.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">Enchantment healed his weary feet<br />
That over hills were doomed to roam;<br />
And forth he hastened, strong and fleet,<br />
And grasped at moonbeams glistening.<br />
Through woven woods in Elvenhome<br />
She lightly fled on dancing feet,<br />
And left him lonely still to roam<br />
In the silent forest listening</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">He heard there oft the flying sound<br />
Of feet as light as linden-leaves,<br />
Or music welling underground,<br />
In hidden hollows quavering.<br />
Now withered lay the hemlock-sheaves,<br />
And one by one with sighing sound<br />
Whispering fell the beachen leaves<br />
In the wintry woodland wavering.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">He sought her ever, wandering far<br />
Where leaves of years were thickly strewn,<br />
By light of moon and ray of star<br />
In frosty heavens shivering<br />
Her mantle glinted in the moon,<br />
As on a hill-top high and far<br />
She danced, and at her feet was strewn<br />
A mist of silver quivering.<br />
When winter passed, she came again,<br />
And her song released the sudden spring,<br />
Like rising lark, and falling rain,<br />
And melting water bubbling.<br />
He saw the elven-flowers spring<br />
About her feet, and healed again<br />
He longed by her to dance and sing<br />
Upon the grass untroubling.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">Again she fled, but swift he came.<br />
Tinúviel! Tinúviel!<br />
He called her by her elvish name;<br />
And there she halted listening.<br />
One moment stood she, and a spell<br />
His voice laid on her: Beren came,<br />
And doom fell on Tinúviel<br />
That in his arms lay glistening.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">As Beren looked into her eyes<br />
Within the shadows of her hair,<br />
The trembling starlight of the skies<br />
He saw there mirrored shimmering.<br />
Tinúviel the elven-fair,<br />
Immortal maiden elven-wise,<br />
About him cast her shadowy hair<br />
And arms like silver glimmering.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">Long was the way that fate them bore,<br />
O'er stony mountains cold and grey,<br />
Through halls of ireon and darkling door,<br />
And woods of nightshade morrowless.<br />
The Sundering Seas between them lay,<br />
And yet at last they met once more,<br />
And long ago they passed away<br />
In the forest singing sorrowless.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">- - - - - - - - - - -</p>
