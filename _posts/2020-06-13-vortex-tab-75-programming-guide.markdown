I need to write it down here so there will be no need to visit Vortex Gears's incomplete documentation in the future.


### Programming
- Plug in the cable, you need the LED to guide you
- `PN` + `LEFT_CTRL` (original position) to enter programming mode
- Press the key that want to be programmed
- Press the target key
- `PN` to apply
- `PN` + `LEFT_CTRL` to exit

It's possible to lose a key. Sometimes you need to backup it first. Be careful.

### Reset
- Reset the current layer key-codes: Hold `PN` + `R` (original position)
- Reset all layersâ€™ key-codes and restore it to default: Hold `LEFT_ALT` + `RIGHT_ALT` (original position)

### Bluetooth
- `PN` + `LEFT_ALT` (on the left of the space bar key) for 3 seconds
- `PN` + `J` or `K` or `L` (current position)
- Pair the device

### Layer
