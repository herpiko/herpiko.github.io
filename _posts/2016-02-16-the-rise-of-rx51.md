That was a long time since my beloved Nokia N900 rover was almost dead. The GSM module has a malfunction and throw this "All telephony functions disabled due to a communication error" error. But now, my rover has been combined with cho2's and able to wake up again with no problem.

Now, the hacking time. I've done this many times, and IMHO, the steps bellow should be done in this sequence.

- Reflash
- Update repository
- Check Application Manager log, remove deprecated repository
- Install CSSU-thumbs -> reboot
- Update package
- Install faster application manager
- Customize and/or install more package from application manager.
- Be aware of crucial package that related to kernel
