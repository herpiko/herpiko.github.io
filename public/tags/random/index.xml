      <description>&lt;p&gt;When I was struggling to find any comfort place for working remotely in Denpasar, a friend mentioned TB Kesiman. I thanked her. TB Kesiman is a home for many good books, some of them are considered rare and antique. Unlike Kineruku (will write about this soon), only about 1/3 of the books are fiction, but they are carefully curated and, as I said before, some of them are rare items. Rare enough to make me hate this small library.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
