You can read the previous post <a href="/2018/failed-attemps-of-being-minimalist-1/">here</a>.

I often requestioned myself whether I still need to be a minimalist or not. In the middle of 2018, I got these books that help me to answer the question.

- Good bye, things - Fumio Sasaki
- The Life Changing Magic of Tidying Up - Marie Kondo

"Good bye, things" contains an extreme guide to be a minimalist. Fumio Sasaki is a single man in his 40 year and he is happy man. I'm single too now but have no planning to be a single in such long time. Many advices in "Good bye, Things" can not be done if we live together with someone. Marie Kondo's book is less extreme but I still favor Fumio Sasaki's.

Few weeks after reading Fumio Sasaki's books and declutered 2 huge bag of junks, I feel good.

But, from time to time I found myself dumbly doing nothing in my room. I just sit in the floor and relaxed, don't know what to do as there is no stuff to do with. There is a weird feeling occured and forced me to rethinking, what I want to do with my life? Is there anything important to do? Why am I still sitting here? It's a good feeling, that weird feeling, a weird starting point to have a productive day.

So, one of the reason that I failed (see previous post) is I still see minimalist as a goal. Minimalist itself is not a goal. It's a starting point, a way. One of the main goal of being a minimalist is happiness. I've to answer to this type of question : Is the stuff I bought makes me happy? Unfornatunately the answer is, yes. So there is no need to be a minimalist?

Again, is the stuff I bought makes me happy? Yes. I still can buy things I love, but fewer and only the important one. Marie Kondo called it, spark of joy. Now it's not about whether I need to be a minimalist or not. It's about live our life and pursuing the happiness, in this case,  using minimalist as a way. Being minimalist needs time and it may be a lifelong doing. I may keep declutering things for the rest of my life.

In the next post I'll share how I declutering things, what hold me to do so, what makes me easy to do it, etc.
