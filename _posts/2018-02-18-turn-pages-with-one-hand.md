I used to read on the commuter. I'm standing, my left hand gripping on the train handle and my right hand holding the book. I learned how to turn pages only with one hand (only applied to small-sized books, around 15-18cm) but I found this interesting video above that teaches how to turn pages with the left hand (on right-to-left Japanese book), which has more advantages than doing it with right hand. I'm thinking of doing something productive with my right hand (snacking, writing, sort of).

I've tried hard to turn the goddamn page from right to left with my left pinkie, and I can't. It supposed to be turned to right just like the Japanese books.  I should find a way. This is me turning the pages with right hand as usual.
