## Hi,

I'm a software engineer who passionate about free and open source software. I currently work for <a href="https://play3.gg/">a web3 startup company</a> and I'm still hacking on <a href="https://github.com/blankon/">BlankOn projects</a>.

Beside my writing, I've not much to tell about myself: I do some <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/herpiko">open source projects</a>. I took <a target="_blank" href="/photographs">some photographs</a>. I was once <a href="https://ww1.worldcubeassociation.org/persons/2010AGUN01">a speedcuber</a> but I quit quietly after realizing <a href="https://ww1.worldcubeassociation.org/results/rankings/333/single">how fast kids these days</a>. I occasionally <a href="/tech_talks">give talks to some events</a>. My current unique <a href="/images/herpiko.png">avatar</a> is made by <a href="https://www.plurk.com/lukmandisini" target="_blank">https://www.plurk.com/lukmandisini</a> (that is not how I look like but somehow it represents my personality). I <a href="/images/books.jpg">love books</a> and this is what Gandalf said in An Unexpected Party, The Hobbit, "I am looking for someone to share in an adventure that I am arranging, and it's very difficult to find anyone."
