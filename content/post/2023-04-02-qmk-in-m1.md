Running `./util/qmk_install.sh` won't work. You need rosetta-enabled terminal session then run these command below:

~~~bash
$ arch -x86_64 /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
$ arch -x86_64 /usr/local/bin/brew install qmk/qmk/qmk
~~~

After that, `qmk` is accessible from anywhere, even from non-rosetta terminal session.

Happy hacking!
