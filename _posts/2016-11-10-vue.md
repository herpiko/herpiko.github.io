The first time I heard about Vue was last year and didn't pay enough attention. People talks this and that, and I stay happy with Angular. Now I'm tired of Angular, haven't choose yet between Angular2 or React for the future use.

So (for educational purpose) I'm making a complete telegram clone app using socket.io and take a try with Vue.

It is so simple. Really,  I was surprised by the simplicity of Vue. It's like Angular but more clean and elegant. I took days for learning Angular at the first time, but its only several hours for Vue. The documentation is quite comprehensive.

The only dissapointment for me is the reactivity part. The unability of Vue to detect object changes seamessly like Angular. We need to Vue.set them. Other than that, Vue is cool!
