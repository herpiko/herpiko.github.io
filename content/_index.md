## Hi,

I'm a software engineer who passionate about free and open source software.

Beside my writing, I've not much to tell about myself: I took <a target="_blank" href="/photographs">some photographs</a>, I was once <a target="_blank" href="https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/persons/2010AGUN01">a speedcuber</a> but I quit quietly years ago realizing <a target="_blank" href="https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/results/rankings/333/single">how crazy kids these days</a>, I occasionally <a target="_blank" href="/tech_talks">give talks to some events</a>. My current unique <a target="_blank" href="/images/herpiko.png">avatar</a> is made by <a target="_blank" href="https://www.plurk.com/lukmandisini" target="_blank">a friend</a> I've never meet in person (that is not how I look but somehow it represents my personality to some degree). I enjoy crafting/building things, whether it's <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/herpiko?tab=repositories&q=&type=source&language=&sort=stargazers">software</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/herpiko/unk">hardware</a>, or <a target="_blank" href="/images/sketch.png">art</a>. I <a target="_blank" href="/images/books.jpg">love books</a>, my favourite author is JRR Tolkien and this is what <a target="_blank" href="/images/gandalf.gif">Mithrandir</a> said in The Hobbit, Chapter I: An Unexpected Party,

<blockquote style="color:grey;">I am looking for someone to share in an adventure that I am arranging, and it's very difficult to find anyone.</blockquote>

I can be reached at herpiko@gmail.com.
