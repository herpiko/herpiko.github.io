I think the luckiest people are those who have people that care about them and know how to accept and appreciate that care properly. One of the shapes of caring is feedback, which sometimes is hard to swallow. Thus, delivering one requires specific skills just as important as receiving one.

When someone has concern about their friend, coworker, or even their favorite barista’s latte art skills, that concern often comes from a place of wanting them to do better, not from wanting to tear them down. But the way that concern is packaged matters—a lot.

Feedback is not always hard to swallow—it depends on how it’s delivered. A blunt “this is bad” will make anyone defensive, while a “hey, I think if you tweak this part, it’ll be amazing” feels more like a hand reaching out to help.

The giver has the power to make feedback feel like a gift or a punch in the gut. Tone, timing, and empathy are everything. Deliver it too late, and it’s irrelevant. Deliver it with too much ego, and it becomes an attack. But deliver it with care and honesty, and it becomes fuel for growth.

And the receiver? Well, that’s another story. Being open to feedback means setting aside your pride for a moment and remembering that this person might just be rooting for you. It’s not always easy, but when both sides—giver and receiver—get it right, feedback stops being this scary, bitter pill and starts feeling more like a secret weapon.

At the end of the day, growth doesn’t just come from wins and praises—it comes from those uncomfortable moments when someone cared enough to tell you the truth. If we can see feedback as a mirror instead of a weapon, we’ll not only avoid taking it personally, but we’ll also use it to become the best version of ourselves. That’s how we grow—one honest conversation at a time.
