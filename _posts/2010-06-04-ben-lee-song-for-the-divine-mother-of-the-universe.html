<p>Sweet Mother I'm coming home (x2)<br />
now I know I'm not alone (x2)<br />
cause' I've been far, (x2)<br />
But now I'm close (x2) EVERY VERSE IS REPEATED.<br />
Sweet mother I'm comin' home<br />
tell Me mother can you hear me sing?<br />
your love is everything<br />
heart and soul,<br />
breath and skin<br />
your love is everything<br />
oh, mother please hold me tight<br />
cause' mother I need some help tonight<br />
and what went wrong,<br />
will soon be right,<br />
oh, mother please hold me tight<br />
tell me mother can you hear me sing?<br />
your love is everything<br />
heart and soul,<br />
breath and skin,<br />
your love is everything,<br />
oh, mother this world is strange,<br />
love me mother and make me brave,<br />
in my dreams,<br />
or on this stage,<br />
oh, mother this world is strange<br />
tell me mother can you hear me sing?<br />
your love is everything,<br />
heart and soul,<br />
breath and skin<br />
your love is everything</p>
