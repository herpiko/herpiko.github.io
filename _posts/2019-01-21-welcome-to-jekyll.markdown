Keeping an old instance of Jekyll is really getting me nuts. If you try to rebuild your old-generated-Jekyll blog on new machine, it may fails as dependency hell in Ruby is real. It forced me to install new version of Jekyll, generate it from scratch then move the files into the new one.

I'm thinking of moving to <a href="https://gohugo.io/">Hugo</a>. So here is the original welcome-to-jekyll text that you've been expected.

You’ll find this post in your `_posts` directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run `jekyll serve`, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.

To add new posts, simply add a file in the `_posts` directory that follows the convention `YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext` and includes the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}
