Three of us sing it<br>
Folding our hope restlessly<br>
Our prays are flying<br>
<br>
The knot was curled<br>
Both of you pulled it far<br>
Without a wise thought<br>
<br>
It locked like hell<br>
So I am going to release<br>
This cursed hot rope<br>
<br>
Let you both be free<br>
All the mistakes are mine sure<br>
I will swallow them<br>
<br>
Burry the past please<br>
Both of you are priceless pals<br>
I beg, forgive me<br>
<br>
Let me fade out here<br>
There, take your time as you wish<br>
My turn, I wait for<br>
<br><br>

This poem follows strict Haiku rules, 3 lines, 5-7-5 syllables in its stanzas. I was trying to write a Haiku in Bahasa Indonesia but turn out that I couldn't write a good one. Words in Bahasa Indonesia contain too much syllables which mean the Haiku stanza will uses less words and it's hard to compose deep meaning with less words.

Consider some sentences of the poem in Bahasa Indonesia,

Kami bertiga bernyanyi, 8 syllables.
Tolong kubur masa lalu, 8 syllables.

They only use 5 syllables in English. Even if I cut bernyanyi to nyanyi--which makes it sounds weird--it still contains too much syllables.

This is the first time I write a Haiku poem.
