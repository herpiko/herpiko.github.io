There is rubik's cube<br>
With its twisted blocks that elude<br>
And my fingertricks that rube<br>
As I love the most as boy<br>
The easiest among toys<br>

There is math<br>
Damned symbol and number beneath<br>
Equations and I don't know, heck<br>
Done with pencil and paper on my desk<br>
The most intriguing of knowledge<br>

There is life!<br>
To learn to sail, I've<br>
Merely I knew nothing of the path<br>
But there are clues and hopes I gath<br>
The most important, toward the grave, afterlife<br>

And there is yourself<br>
Weird mind and heart<br>
Wild desire and dream<br>
Labyrinth of strong-wise woman<br>
The hardest I ever faced<br>

Neither I can solve nor understand<br>
I'm not giving up, O Wolf!<br>
Till you're willing to solve mine, till old<br>
