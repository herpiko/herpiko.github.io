<p>once upon a time a bird fell in love with a white rose. one day she, the bird, proposed to him, the white rose, but the white rose refused. white rose said "i don't love you". the bird came daily and proposed to the white rose. finally, the white rose said "when i will turn red, i will love you". one day the bird came and cut her wings and spread her blood on the white rose and the rose turned red. then the rose realized how much the bird loved him but it was too late because the bird was dead.</p>
<h6>so respect the love and feelings of the person who loves you.</h6>
