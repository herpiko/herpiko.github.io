Hi,

I'm a software developer. I also lead R&D team of non-profit organization, BlankOn project, which releases one of the biggest GNU/Linux distribution in Indonesia. I love bicycling, currently using an upgraded Doppelganger FX05.

I can be reached at herpiko [at] gmail [dot] com.

And this is what Gandalf said in An Unexpected Party, The Hobbit, "I am looking for someone to share in an adventure that I am arranging, and it's very difficult to find anyone."
