      <description>&lt;p&gt;Sublime Text was my favourite text editor, I&amp;rsquo;ve been following it since its early days. The feature I most liked and can&amp;rsquo;t live without is the multiple cursors selection. Sublime Text lets you to select and edit string on multiple place at once based on pattern that you defined. I think it was a pain killer feature. The thing was that I always want to go back to Vim. The day I found this repository (&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/terryma/vim-multiple-cursors)&#34;&gt;https://github.com/terryma/vim-multiple-cursors)&lt;/a&gt;, I switched back to Vim. &lt;code&gt;vim-multiple-cursors&lt;/code&gt; is easy and intuitive as Sublime Text&amp;rsquo;s althought it&amp;rsquo;s a bit different in usage. But nowdays &lt;code&gt;vim-multiple-cursors&lt;/code&gt; has been broken, especially on the latest Vim release.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
