This is an intro from one of the Yuna's songs. A deep parable.
<br><br>
<hr>
<br>
Sometimes you find yourself trying to let go of something
<br>But it's like, you have been swimming on the ocean for a very very long time
<br>And you feel like you belong there
<br>You are one with the waves
<br>The warmth of the water
<br>And your body moves in sync with the ocean
<br>And you swim around just trying to stay afloat
<br>Then you get tired and you start to drown
<br>And you swim back to land
<br>When you get there you just feel so heavy because you lost touch with gravity for so long
<br>And you collapse on the beach as you try to find balance again
<br>And then your feet finds gravity
<br>You stand up and you look at the horizon one last time
<br>And you just know that no matter how beautiful the sea was
<br>And how good it made you feel It was never yours to keep
<br>And somedays you'll miss it, you know
<br>And you feel yourself moving with the waves and you dream of diving in
<br>Then you realize your feet was meant for land
<br>And not cut out for the ocean
<br>Maybe you're meant to climb trees, or hike hills, or just run really fast
<br>Letting go is not easy
<br>There's nothing quite like swimming in the ocean
<br>Just like how it's natural for your feet to find gravity
<br>It's natural for you to let go
<br>And find your true purpose in life again
<br>The sea is the sea
<br>And you are just you
<br><br>I have to let go
<br>But sometimes I find myself waking up at the beach again
