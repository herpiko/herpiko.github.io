My motivation is that I want to get visualized report of my monthly expenses. I'm using Jenius heavily but their app does not provide such report. The original code was a CLI program and has been written since November 2019 then Jenius CoCreation Week 2020 Hackathon submission came out. I submitted the idea but it fail miserably. Since the original motivation is not to winning a hackathon prize but to get the report that I want, I continued to code for Jentor. It's not perfect, some bugs may occur.

I'm hoping for Jenius to providing parseable output from the transaction history (like plaintext or CSV) instead of PDF. PDF is known hard for parsing. <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=22473263">This</a> may explains the reasons better than me.
