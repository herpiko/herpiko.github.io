      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-rejection-and-acceptance&#34;&gt;The Rejection and Acceptance&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When I first heard about Louca 2023, I was very excited and immediately submit two abstracts. I was convinced that one my submissions is interesting enough to be accepted, except is was not. None of my submissions made it but I am in no doubt that the accepted topics that was listed in the Louca webiste were a lot more interesting.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Then one month before the event, I was contacted by one of the organizer. I was asked whether I still want to talk in the event. Maybe someone has to stepped down from the position. They said the topic that they accepted is the one that is less preferable for me (because it&amp;rsquo;s quite a heavy topic). I have to made the proof of concept in less than a month. So it was a bit roller coaster here but the second excitement is real here! :D&lt;/p&gt;</description>
