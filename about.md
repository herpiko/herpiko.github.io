Hi,

I'm a software engineer. I love bicycling, currently using an upgraded <a href="http://www.doppelganger.jp/product/fx05/">Doppelganger FX05</a>. I also love reading books, my oldest collection is a copy of <a href="http://www.pprize.com/BookDetail.php?bk=10">Thornton Wilder's The Bridge of San Luis Rey</a> that printed in 1928.

I can be reached at herpiko [at] gmail [dot] com.

And this is what Gandalf said in An Unexpected Party, The Hobbit, "I am looking for someone to share in an adventure that I am arranging, and it's very difficult to find anyone."
