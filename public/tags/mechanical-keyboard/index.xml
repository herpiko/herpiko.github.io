      <title>QMK Firmware in M1</title>

      <description>Running ./util/qmk_install.sh won&amp;rsquo;t work. You need rosetta-enabled terminal session then run these command below:
$ arch -x86_64 /bin/bash -c &amp;#34;$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)&amp;#34; $ arch -x86_64 /usr/local/bin/brew install qmk/qmk/qmk After that, qmk is accessible from anywhere, even from non-rosetta terminal session.
This is UNK after being flashed directly from a M1 computer:
Happy hacking!</description>

      <description>As a person who have been using Thinkpad computers for years, I was always missing the trackpoint feature. I want to type on mechanical keyboard but also I don&amp;rsquo;t willing to dismiss the nipple. There are few solution for this issue: UHK, Tex Yoda, Tex Shinobi. These all are expensive keyboard, the shipping cost alone is crazy.
Trackpoint module is one of my goals while building UNK and I successfully build it.</description>
