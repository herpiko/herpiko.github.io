<br>No seat is empty
<br>Except the one beside mine
<br>Poor heart so empty

<br>The train move so fast
<br>Breaking my sole emptiness
<br>Except it can not

<br>As you are not here
<br>But your vague shadow is
<br>Imaginable

<br>Tremendously sad
<br>Our broken promises and dreams
<br>Almost empty now

<br>So what is empty
<br>If sadness fails to fill it
<br>This, I shall answer

<br>A little pain here
<br>Pure loneliness, my dear friend
<br>Everyone's fear
<br>

<br>What I can not avoided when writing haikus is counting the syllables using my fingers. It may cause fatigue on my hand as I've to rewrite it many times. Haikus is fun but sometimes it's hard to achieve both sharp meanings and obeyed rules.
